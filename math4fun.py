#potential improvement call the numbers by function (so specific parameters per operator)  cuz no one finna be doing 99*45 in their head for fun
#obiously add more shit like to the power of, roots, matrices, vectors etc.
#make a choice menu
#somehow find a way to 'show' like integration signs and that shit cuz it makes it a lot easier to read
